		Marvell CN106XX BSP


1. About this document
======================
This document describes the common and non-hardware specific information.
Please refer to README.hardware for hardware specific information.

Dependencies
------------
This layer depends on the oe-core version supplied with linux-yocto kernel.

Maintenance
-----------
This layer is maintained by Wind River Systems, Inc.
Contact <support@windriver.com> or your support representative for more
information on submitting changes.

Building the marvell-cn106xx layer
----------------------------------
This layer should be added to bblayers.conf. This is done automatically
when using the Wind River setup.sh wrapper.

2. BSP Kernel and Distros
=========================

The following table summarizes the valid Wind River Linux distros for this BSP.
'Y' in each content cell stands for supported; 'N' stands for not supported:

  +--------------+-------------+-------------+-------------+
  | valid/distro |   wrlinux   | wrlinux-cgl | wrlinux-ovp |
  +--------------+-------------+-------------+-------------+
  |    valid     |      Y      |      N      |      N      |
  +--------------+-------------+-------------+-------------+

For the supported kernel type for this BSP, please check the TARGET_SUPPORTED_KTYPES
by running 'bitbake -e virtual/kernel | grep "^TARGET_SUPPORTED_KTYPES="'.

Note: The preempt-rt ktype is available for this BSP/Machine.


3. Board Specific Patches
=========================

To get a list of patches applied to the kernel specific to this BSP
along with patch descriptions use git whatchanged on the default
kernel (git whatchanged <kernel_type>..<bsp_name>). For example:

  # cd tmp-glibc/work-shared/<bsp_name>/kernel-source
  # git whatchanged standard/base..standard/<machine name>


4. Boot Instructions
====================

The typical u-boot settings apply to these boards. You will need to use
setenv, printenv and saveenv, to configure, display and store respectively
your network configuration details and kernel command line. In order to
TFTP a kernel, you need at a minimum to set the following:

	- ipaddr
	- gatewayip
	- netmask
	- serverip
	- loadaddr
	- ethaddr
	- eth1addr

Your board may ship with the values for the MAC address of
the Ethernet interfaces set to the defaults compiled into the
u-boot image.  You should set the ethaddr, eth1addr and so on
as per the manufacturer assigned values, usually indicated with
a sticker on the board.

Target specifics are usually set in the "bootargs" variable, and the
kernel image is set in the "bootfile" variable. Don't forget that if you
want these values to be available after a power cycle you will need to run
the saveenv command.

Typically convenience macros exist that will create a complete bootargs
command line for the kernel based on variables that contain individual
settings.  Since these macros exist as env variables themselves, they
may or may not be present depending on who installed and configured
u-boot for the board.

The console device for the board is ttyAMA0 at 115200 baud. The load address
must be high enough to not interfere with kernel decompression.  A value of
0x040080000 was used with success for all kernels tested by Wind River.

4.1 NFS Root File System
------------------------

Example settings for the monitor (u-boot) are shown below:

nfsboot=setenv bootargs root=/dev/nfs rw nfsroot=$serverip:$rootpath \
ip=$ipaddr:$serverip:$gatewayip:$netmask:$hostname:$netdev:off \
console=$consoledev,$baudrate $othbootargs;tftpboot $loadaddr $bootfile; \
booti $loadaddr - $fdtaddr
ethaddr=00:04:9F:02:00:FD
eth1addr=00:04:9F:02:01:FD
eth2addr=00:04:9F:02:02:FD
loadaddr=0x040080000
gatewayip=192.168.1.1
netmask=255.255.255.0
ipaddr=192.168.1.100
serverip=192.168.1.2
netdev=eth1
ethact=eth1
bootfile=Image
rootpath=/tftpboot/rootfs
consoledev=ttyAMA0
baudrate=115200


5. WIC Image
============
Please refer to the Yocto manual for the detailed info about WIC. After building
the project, the WIC image is at:
   tmp-glibc/deploy/images/marvell-cn106xx/wrlinux-image-std-<machine name>.wic

Then user can burn this image to eMMC on board.

note: Due to hardware problems, SD card is not supported temporarily.

5.1 Burn the image to eMMC device
-----------------------------
    # dd if=wrlinux-image-std-<machine name>.wic of=/dev/your_emmc_dev bs=1M conv=fsync

5.2 Set uboot env for cn106xx
-----------------------------
    # fatload mmc 0:1 $loadaddr Image
    # setenv bootargs console=ttyAMA0,115200n8 earlycon=pl011,0x87e028000000 maxcpus=24 rootwait rw root=/dev/mmcblk0p2 coherent_pool=16M iommu.passthrough=1
    # booti $loadaddr - $fdtaddr


6. Multilib
===========

By default, when you configure project with --enable-board=marvell-cn106xx,
the BSP is configured as a 64-bit kernel and 64-bit userspace.

Multilib is also supported by this BSP.

1. To add 32-bit multilib support for an existing project, use:

    bitbake lib32-wrlinux-image-std

2. To add 32-bit multilib support for a specific package, use:

    bitbake lib32-<pkg-name>


7. Switch CPSS demo
===================

Due to the license issue, we can't provide either the CPSS source or binary
package in Wind River Linux. If you really need this application, please follow
the below steps to build the CPSS application:

1) Copy sources-cpss-SDK11.22.05.tar.bz2 from the SDK11 and put it to <bsp-layer>/downloads/ directory

2) Add line as follows to ${build dir}/conf/local.conf:
     $ cat << _EOF >> conf/local.conf
PNWHITELIST:wr-marvell-cn106xx += "cpss"
IMAGE_INSTALL:append = " cpss"
_EOF

3) Build CPSS demo use 'bitbake cpss' or 'bitbake wrlinux-image-std'

4) Rpm package can be found in ${build dir}/tmp-glibc/deploy/rpm/neoversen2_crypto/


Example config for the cpss program is shown below, we can use 'appDemo -config cpss.conf' to configure
switch function:

    $ cat << _EOF >> cpss.conf
// InitSystem
shell-execute appDemoDbEntryAdd "initPhy",0
shell-execute appDemoDbEntryAdd "noSdmaRxTxPP0",1
shell-execute appDemoDbEntryAdd "noCpu",1
shell-execute appDemoDbEntryAdd "initNetworkIf",0
autoInitSystem noPorts
shell-execute nwa_disable_sdma2cpu_wa
